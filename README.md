I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate at Boston University. Originally, I'm from eastern Washington state, but I've also lived in Portland, Montana, and Grenoble, France. I've accumulated and organized a few of the more substantial projects I've been a team member of thus far in college, as well as a few other random projects, assignments, and personal creations- I thought they were fun & interesting to build, so I hope you do too!
