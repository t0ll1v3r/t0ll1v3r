I'm a Computer Engineering undergraduate at Boston University. I primarily grew up in eastern Washington state, but I've also lived in Eureka, MT, Portland, OR, and Grenoble, FR. I've accumulated and organized a few of the more substantial projects I've been a team member of thus far in college, some projects I've built or contributed to at work, as well as a few other random projects, assignments, and personal creations- I thought they were fun & interesting to build and iterate, so I hope you do too!
